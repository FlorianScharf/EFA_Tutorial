## Check if necessary packages are installed and if not
# install them

## Load packages
library(psych)

## empty work space

## Load pre-processed data

## Select group to be analyzed
# ad = adults; ch = children

## Prepare data set 
# Select a subset of the data based on the chosen group
# delete all variable except for the sampling points (necessary for the pca functions)

############### 2a:Determination of the Number of Factors ############### 

## Compute correlation matrix of the sampling points 
# to be used for the Empirical Kaiser Criterion (EKC)
# Attention: R should ONLY contain correlations between the variables
# which shall enter the pca. Please make sure to remove any indicator variables
# such as participant or condition ID before computing R!
R = cor(age_group_data)

## Determine number of factors using 
# This function is taken from the package EFAtools. 
source('tools/EKC.R')
res_ekc = EKC(R, N = nrow(age_group_data))

## Save the resulting number of factors
nFac = res_ekc$n_factors

## Print the number of factors
nFac

## Plot the variance explained by each factor in the initial
# solution, we cut the solution at 40 factors just to make the
# cut point more visible.

# Eigen values of the data

# Uncomment and replace nFac if you want to overwrite
# the EKC result and use a different number of factors

############### 2b: Estimation of unrotated factor loadings ############### 

## Estimate unrotated factor loadings
# This function is adapted from the package psych. We slightly modified it to 
# improve estimation speed. The original function tries to compute a number of
# fit indices which are not relevant for our purposes. However, this computation
# is very slow for data sets as large as ours and it often results in irrelevant 
# warnings about non-convergence of the fit index estimation. Otherwise, the
# function is not changed.
source("tools/fa_simplified.R")

# The argument covar = TRUE is set in order to produce an unstandardized 
# solution as intended.
pcaFit = fa_simplified(r = age_group_data, nfactors = nFac, rotate = "none", covar = TRUE)

# We add a number of relevant descriptive statistics to the fit object
# which we use again in later steps.

S = cov(age_group_data)
Sinv = ginv(S)
Rinv = ginv(R)
Var = diag(S)
varSD = sqrt(Var)

pcaFit$S = S # Sample Covariance Matrix
pcaFit$Sinv = Sinv # (Moore-Penrose) Inverse of the Sample Covariance Matrix
pcaFit$R = R # Sample Correlation Matrox
pcaFit$Rinv = Rinv # (Moore-Penrose) Inverse of the Sample Covariance Matrix
pcaFit$varSD = varSD # SDs of the Sampling Points
pcaFit$Var = Var # Variances of the Sampling Points
pcaFit$group = group

# Finally, we save the unrotated solutions in a separate file for the
# next analysis steps. 
# The file name is automatically adjusted to include group name
# and number of factors.
