############### STEP 5a: Jackknife resampling ###############

#### NOTE:
#### This script runs for several hours on typical hardware. Do only run when 
#### you are prepared to wait for the results this long.

## Load necessary packages
if(!require(foreach)) install.packages("foreach")
if(!require(doParallel)) install.packages("doParallel")
library(foreach)
library(doParallel)
library(psych)
library(GPArotation)

## Setup parallel environment
# The resampling is conducted in a parallel environment
# each single core estimates the EFA model for a different jackknife sample.
# The higher the number of cores the faster this will be.
# We recommend to use as many cores as your computer has available minus one 
# to prevent overload. If you use a computing cluster with many cores:
# The script will not benefit from more than 32 cores because this is the number
# of jackknife samples.

# Return the number of cores available
detectCores(logical = TRUE)

# Set number of cores
cores <-  32 # change manually

# Prepare parallel environment
cl <- makeCluster(cores[1], outfile = "")
registerDoParallel(cl)

# Load raw data
load("results/01_data_import/erpdata.Rdata")

# Group labels to iterate through
groups <- c("ad", "ch") 

# How many factors should be extracted per group?
# This should match the number of factors from the EFA over all participants.
nFac <- c(23,21)

# go through both groups
for (iGroup in groups){ 
  
  # set number of factors to be extracted accordingly

    # The following code essentially replicates the estimation of the EFA model 
    # in step 2 for every jackknife subsample. 
    # We only increased the number of maximum iterations for the rotation as well
    # as the number of random starts to prevent suboptimal results due to 
    # local optima or non-convergence in single samples.

    # two iterations. We recommend against using lower values 
    # (this is the GPArotation default) since it can prevent
    # the algorithm from converging.
