## DEPENDENCY: GPArotation
# If you want to use other rotation criteria, you can easily adjust this function by
# changing the value of the method argument into any rotation available here:
# ?GPArotation::GPFoblq
# For orthogonal solutions, you could replace GPFoblq with GPForth 
# We did not implement this here because we strongly recommend to use oblique rotations
# for ERP data as outlined in the article.
