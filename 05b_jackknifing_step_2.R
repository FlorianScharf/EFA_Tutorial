############### Extract the individual peak latencie estimates ###############

# The following code loads all jackknifeFits and extracts individual 
# latency estimates for the requested components
# in addition, a diagnostic plot of the subsample loadings is provided
# so that problems with factor alingment or stability of the factor solution can be detected
indLatEst <- lapply(jackknifeFits, FUN = function(iFit){
  # get index of current fit 
  iFitIdx <- which(iFit == jackknifeFits)
  # get index of factor to be analyzed
  iFacIdx <- facIdx[iFitIdx] 
  # load current fit 
  load(iFit)
  # load respective total fit object
  load(totalFits[iFitIdx])
  
  # extract sample size
  N <- length(rotFitAll) # there are as many fits as participants
  
  # apply convenience function to extract loadings and peak latencies
  out <- evalIndFits(rotFit, rotFitAll, iFacIdx, crit)
  # convert indices to seconds
  lat <- (out["latIdx",] - 1) / srate + xmin
  # Estimate individual latencies; Smulders, 2010, eq. (1)
  indLat <- N * mean(lat) - (N - 1) * lat

  # restructure the loadings to make plotting easier
  loadings = data.frame(timeAxis = (0:(pnts - 1)) / srate + xmin, out[-1,])

# name list elements by the files inserted to exclude confusion from
# indexing

###############

############### Show diagnostic plots ###############
# ideally, the individual loadings should be highly similar
# any indication that the factor structure varies drastically between
# subsamples should be inspected closely!
indLatEst[[1]]$diagPlot
indLatEst[[2]]$diagPlot
###############

############### Subject latencies to a test ###############
# frequentist and bayesian t tests
t.test(indLatEst[[1]]$indLat, indLatEst[[2]]$indLat)
ttestBF(indLatEst[[1]]$indLat, indLatEst[[2]]$indLat)
###############

############### Notes on further use of indices ###############

# indLatEst is a so-called list object 
# it contains as many elements as fit objects were provided 
# each element can be accessed by simple indexing:
indLatEst[[1]]
# or altenatively by the names of the jackknife fit files:
indLatEst$rotfit_ad25_jkpca.Rdata_facIdx_5

## Each element contains three elements:
# individual latency estimates
indLatEst[[1]]$indLat
# the diagnostic plot of the subsample loadings
indLatEst[[1]]$diagPlot
# a data frame with all subsample loadings 
indLatEst[[1]]$loadings
# note that participant note the participant who was EXCLUDED
# in that specific jackknife subsample
